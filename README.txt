With our project we intend to resolve one of the leading problems faced by college students - that of obtaining quality food in the least time possible. Our application aims at digitalizing all hostel canteens and thereby including their menus, items available, a portal for placing orders, a notification system to inform when the ordered items are ready and a feedback system. We also intend to include monetary matters like monthly stipulated accounts and follow proper authentication practices.
